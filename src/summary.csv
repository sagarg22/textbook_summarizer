The primary one is the use of for loops to perform simple operations over an entire matrix or vector. For example, if the operation is summing all the elements in a matrix, the difference between calling sum and writing a loop that looks like FORTRAN or C code can be astounding; the loop is unbelievably slow owing to the interpreted nature of MATLAB. Consider the three methods for matrix summation in Fig.~※. Three ways to add all the elements of a matrix. For example, a greater than test applied to a matrix returns a matrix of ones and zeros.

Subsequent chapters will introduce the concept of the frequency spectrum of a signal and the concept of filtering with a linear time-invariant system."

25,2.4,"Chapter 2.4: For example, if we wish to plot a function such as which is shown in Fig.~※, we must evaluate at a discrete set of times,, where is an integer. If we do so, we obtain the sequence of samples where is called the sample spacing or sampling period, and is an integer. For example, the MATLAB statements n = -7:5; Ts = 0.005; tn = n*Ts; xn = 20*cos(80*pi*tn - 0.4*pi); plot(tn,xn) would create a row vector tn of 13 numbers between and spaced by the sampling period 0.005, and a row vector xn of samples of. However, we learn from this example that as the sampling period decreases, more samples are taken across one cycle of the periodic cosine signal. When, there are 5 samples per cycle; when there are 10 samples per cycle; and when, there are 250 samples per cycle. The choice of also depends on the frequency of the cosine signal, because it is the number of samples per cycle that matters in plotting. For example, if the frequency of the cosine signal were 2000 Hz instead of 40 Hz, then a sample spacing of would yield only 5 samples per cycle."

Geometric view of complex multiplication. The complex number, which is aptly called the complex amplitude, is a polar representation created from the amplitude and the phase shift of the complex exponential signal. The complex amplitude is also called a phasor. The complex exponential signal defined in can also be written as where At a given instant in time,, the value of the complex exponential signal,, is a complex number whose magnitude is and whose argument is. Thus, another name for the complex exponential signal is rotating phasor. The complex amplitude of the positive frequency complex exponential signal is, and the complex amplitude of the negative frequency complex exponential is."

Demo: Tuning Fork General Solution to the Differential Equation There are many possible solutions to the tuning-fork differential equation. From this we can conclude that any scaled or time-shifted sinusoid with the correct frequency will satisfy the differential equation that describes the motion of the tuning forks tine."
29,2.8,"Chapter 2.8: We have seen by both theory and observation that a tuning fork generates a signal that can be represented mathematically as a sinusoidal signal.

36,3.4,"Chapter 3.4: The complex exponential in has a frequency equal to Hz, so all the frequencies are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency Hz. Fourier Series: Analysis How do we derive the coefficients for the harmonic sum, i.e., how do we go from to ? The answer is that we use the Fourier series integral to perform Fourier analysis. The complex amplitudes for any periodic signal can be calculated with the Fourier integral where is the fundamental period of. The Fourier integral is convenient if we have a formula that defines over one period. Fourier Series Derivation In this section, we present a derivation of the Fourier Series integral formula."

38,3.6,"Chapter 3.6: Therefore, we must evaluate separately using The formula for when has a numerator that is either 0 (for even) or 2 (for odd), because alternates between and. Therefore, the final answer for the Fourier series coefficients of the square wave has three cases: Notice that the formula for does not depend on the period,, but this is not usually the case.

Spectrum of a square wave derived from its Fourier Series coefficients. Periodic triangle wave. Unlike the square wave, the triangle wave is a continuous signal. Therefore, it is easier to approximate the triangle wave with a finite Fourier sum."
39,3.7,"Chapter 3.7:  Parsevals Theorem One reason that the Fourier Series is so useful is that there is an equivalence between the sum of the squares of the Fourier coefficients and the signal power. The average power of the periodic signal is the total energy of one period of divided by the duration of the period. The average power is a convenient measure of the size (or strength) of the signal. EXAMPLE Average Power in a Sinusoid. For the case where, the average power integral  can be evaluated directly."
40,3.8,"Chapter 3.8:  The Nature of the Fourier Series Approximation One consequence of Parsevals Theorem is that we can measure the approximation error when the Fourier Series expansion is truncated to the range. As shown in Fig.~※, Parsevals Theorem guarantees that the error power will get small whenever the signal has finite average power. If we define to be the signal formed by a finite sum of complex exponentials: then the error signal is. Thus the power in the overshoot is decreasing — in other words, there is convergence according to the squared error measure, which is confirmed in Fig.~※."
41,3.9,"Chapter 3.9: This leads us to the concept of a time–frequency spectrum or spectrogram. The notation itself is not completely obvious, but the horizontal “axis” in Fig.~※ is time, while the vertical axis is frequency. Sheet music notation is a time–frequency diagram. On the other hand, excellent numerical routines are now available for time–frequency analysis."
42,4.0,"Chapter 4.0:  CHAPTER 4 Sampling and Aliasing This chapter is concerned with the conversion of signals between the analog (continuous-time) and digital (discrete-time) domains. The primary objective of our presentation is an understanding of the Sampling Theorem, which states that when the sampling rate is greater than twice the highest frequency contained in the spectrum of the analog signal, the original signal can be reconstructed exactly from the samples. The process of converting from digital back to analog is called reconstruction. The reconstruction process is basically one of interpolation because we must “fill in” the missing signal values between the sample times by constructing a smooth curve through the discrete-time sample values."
43,4.1,"Chapter 4.1: It is also common to refer to such signals as analog signals because both the signal amplitude and the time variable are assumed to be real (not discrete) numbers.

Now we want to begin to study discrete-time systems where the input and output are discrete-time signals. Since a discrete-time signal is a sequence of numbers, such operators can be described by giving a formula for computing the values of the output sequence from the values of the input sequence."

We will use the FIR case to introduce the important concept of “domains of representation” for discrete-time signals and systems. In this text, we consider three domains of representation of signals and systems: the -domain or time domain (the domain of sequences, impulse responses and difference equations), the -domain or frequency domain (the domain of frequency responses and spectrum representations), and the -domain (the domain of -transforms, operators, and poles and zeros).

The -domain exists primarily for its convenience in mathematical analysis and synthesis."

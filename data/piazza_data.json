      "content":"Please follow the following guidelines when posting on Piazza:1. Piazza is a place to get help or hints, not direct answers. Questions such as: \u201cWhat\u2019s the answer to Problem 1.1?\u201d will be ignored or removed. Similarly, posts that give the answers to specific problems will be removed.2. Questions regarding the methodology of a problem or where to find information pertaining to a problem are encouraged. For example: \u201cI am unclear on how the Fourier coefficients are affected when a constant is added to the function; will someone please explain or provide a location for further information?\u201d3. Piazza is meant to serve as an open and public forum for student discussion of problems. It will be regularly monitored by the instructors, but students are encouraged to use Piazza to both elicit and distribute help to/from other students. Remember Guidelines 1 and 2.4. Before asking a question, read other related posts to ensure that the question has not yet been answered. Duplicate questions will be removed.5. When posting a question, give the post a meaningful title to facilitate searching. &#34;HW 2.5a&#34; is much better than &#34;HW help needed&#34;6. Most Piazza posts should be posted to the entire class. Private posts should be posted to the instructors only when they contain information that should not be released to the entire class (e.g., your MATLAB code, or your work for solving a homework problem).If you want to remain anonymous to your classmates or to everyone, instead of making a private post, you can change the setting that says &#34;Show my name as&#34; at the bottom of creating a new Piazza post.7. Do not post your entire MATLAB code. Only code snippets are allowed to be posted to the entire class. If you are trying to debug your code and cannot find the error, you may make a private Piazza post containing all your code (which is sent only to the instructors).8. Piazza is meant to serve as a mode to quickly and concisely answer student questions. If your question takes a full paragraph to ask or requires extensive explanation then it is better-suited for office hours.9. Questions about grades specific to you should not be posted on Piazza, but instead emailed to the appropriate grader.10. Piazza is meant to serve as a method to supplement student learning. Do not rely on Piazza too heavily as a means to \u201cfind\u201d solutions to problems; it is important to learn the concepts behind the problems and how to apply them, and that requires mind exercises.11. Posts in Piazza should be related to the course.12. Posts in Piazza should be professional and understandable.13. Piazza is a public forum; do not use it for private correspondences. Any post that does not conform to the guidelines will be noted and removed.#pin",

Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are).\n\nEdit questions and answers wiki-style.\n\nThink of Piazza as a Q&A wiki for your class. Every question has just a single students' answer that students can edit collectively (and a single instructors\u2019 answer for instructors).\n\n Add a followup to comment or ask further questions.\n\nTo comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a followup discussion. Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&A above.\n\n Go anonymous.\n\nShy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously.\n\n Tag your posts.\n\nIt's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a \u201c#\u201d before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag.\n\n Format code and equations.\n\nAdding a code snippet? Click the pre or tt button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text. \nMathematical equation? Click the Fx button to access the LaTeX editor to build a nicely formatted equation.\n\n View and download class details and resources. \n\nClick the Course Page button in your top bar to access the class syllabus, staff contact information, office hours details, and course resources\u2014all in one place!\n\n\nContact the Piazza Team anytime with questions or comments at team@piazza.com.

Since we are only dealing with the imaginary component of the summation, only a half circle turn is necessary to produce a 0 sum to return the -j value.\n\nFor example, consider the k=-20 example in the solution key. It is indeed true that a summation of 80 terms would equal 0, but it is also true that a summation of terms k=-19 to k=19 would yield 0 if considering only the imaginary component. Since we are interested in returning -j, which is the starting value of k=-20, only a summation from k=-20 to k=19 is necessary to produce the intended result. This N=19 is the smallest value of N, while N=60 is the next smallest value of N to produce the intended result.\n\nPlease correct me if the above is incorrect.",

We've also linked at the bottom helpful information regarding the Piazza Network, as well as resources for teaching during COVID. In a separate Piazza post, we\u2019ll be sharing product enhancements that we\u2019re working on next.\n\nEnhanced Locking Functionality for Classes\nWith instructors needing to administer online tests, we\u2019ve added new capabilities for you to schedule class lock dates/times from your \u2018Manage Class\u2019 page. We\u2019ve added support so you can lock individual posts as well.\n\nIn addition, while your class is locked, you can allow students to only post privately to instructors, ensuring they have a way to communicate with you while minimizing risk of sensitive content being posted to the class. Shortly, you\u2019ll also have the option to entirely shut down access to your Piazza class while your class is locked.\n\nImproved Piazza Folders Functionality\nWith the input of dozens of instructors, we\u2019ve redesigned folders to better work for your needs. You are now able to more easily create, rename, reorder, and delete folders from your \u2018Manage Class\u2019 page. Changes you make will be pushed in real-time to your open Piazza tabs, making it seamless to add/edit/arrange folders from one tab while you are in the midst of creating a post in another tab.\n\nPiazza \u2018Live Q&A\u2019 For Virtual Lectures/Office Hours\nTo support the transition to virtual lectures and office hours, we launched Live Q&A. Live Q&A allows instructors to easily see and address the questions that students most care about during a live lecture or office hour session. You can host Live Q&A sessions with distinct start and end times, during which students can ask questions and upvote one another\u2019s questions. Questions asked during a Live Q&A session are stored under your Live Q&A feed so as not to clutter your primary class Q&A feed.\n\nMore details on starting Live Q&A for your class can be found here:\nhttps://support.piazza.com/support/solutions/folders/48000670520\n\nClass Reading Lists to Help Students Keep Up-To-Date\nTo help students easily find information related to frequently asked questions, you can now create a reading list for your Piazza class. Posts in the reading list appear in a special \u2018Reading List\u2019 bin right below the pinned posts section of your class feed, and are student-specific. You can also require that students read a particular post in the reading list before being allowed to add a new post, which can help reduce the number of redundant questions.\n\nAdditional information on reading lists can be found here:\nhttps://support.piazza.com/support/solutions/articles/48000986672-instructors-create-a-reading-list-for-your-students\n\nSupport for Copy/Paste and Drag/Drop of Images, Files\nThanks to the input of many professors, we now support copy/paste and drag/drop of images and files in our editor.\n\nAddition of mhchem to Piazza LaTeX Editor\nYou can now write beautiful chemical equations using mhchem, integrated into our LaTeX editor. You can find the manual for the mhchem package here:\nhttps://mhchem.github.io/MathJax-mhchem/\n\nAbility to Edit Resource Section Names\nYou\u2019re now able to edit resource section names in your \u2018Resources\u2019 tab on Piazza.\n\nAbility to Edit Group Names\nYou\u2019re now able to edit group names on Piazza. Groups are a great way to encourage collaboration among smaller groups of students in your class. Visit \u2018Manage Class\u2019 to configure groups.\n\nAdditional details on setting up groups for your class can be found here:\nhttps://support.piazza.com/support/solutions/articles/48000616687-instructors-create-groups\n\nPiazza Available as an App within Microsoft Teams\nPer the request of several professors who were looking to better integrate their students\u2019 experience, Piazza is now available as an app from within Microsoft Teams.\n\nA step-by-step guide to add your class to Teams can be found here:\nhttps://support.piazza.com/support/solutions/articles/48001152480-adding-a-piazza-class-to-microsoft-teams\n\n* * *\n\nWe also wanted to share these additional resources regarding the Piazza Network and insights on teaching during COVID:\n\nHow and Why We Created the Piazza Network\nWith guidance from several professors who had questions regarding the Piazza Network (our separate opt-in service that helps students find jobs and internships), we published an article that outlines how and why we created the Piazza Network. We have grown because of our relationships with professors and the guidance we have received from you over these past ten years. It was important to us to share details on the Piazza Network with you, and to address any misinformation or confusion that may be out there.\n\nAdditional information on how and why we created the Piazza Network can be found here:\nhttps://medium.com/piazza/how-and-why-did-piazza-create-the-piazza-network-4dc8db98b81d\n\nEducator Insights During COVID\nAs instructors are faced with teaching in a new online environment, we\u2019ve started to compile educator insights, which can be found here:\nhttps://medium.com/piazza/tagged/tidbits-to-stay-connected\n\nAs you and your colleagues look to one another for tips to keep students engaged in this new virtual learning environment, we hope these educator insights provide you with ideas that you can take into your class.\n\n\n* * *\n\nWe hope this functionality helps as you manage your course communication on Piazza. Please don\u2019t hesitate to drop our team a note at team@piazza.com with additional ways we can improve your experience on Piazza, or if we can help with setting up your class on Piazza. \n\nPlease feel free to drop in (or have your colleagues drop in) for a live demo or office hour slot with our team at www.calendly.com/piazzasupport.",

      "content":"Dear Instructors, \n\nWe\u2019ve added new capabilities for you to easily create groups in your Piazza class. We also wanted to share product enhancements that we are currently working on.\n\nStreamlining Group Assignments\nWe\u2019ve added the ability for you to upload a CSV file to easily create and assign sections of students to groups on Piazza. This will allow you to create and manage groups in a more automated manner, especially helpful for larger classes.\n\nYou can access this feature from your \u2018Manage Class\u2019 page under the \u2018Create Groups\u2019 section.\n\nNew 'Student Participation Export' Console\nWe are designing a new \u2018Student Participation Export\u2019 console that will allow you to easily export contributions and participation stats to a specific post or set of posts. The report will tally contributions and statistics by student, and will include follow up comments, replies to comments, as well as contributions and upvotes to Live Q&A posts. You\u2019ll also have the ability to schedule exports for future dates/times.\n\nThe \u2018Student Participation Export\u2019 console will be available in the coming weeks from your \u2018Statistics\u2019 page.\n\nEnhancements to Polls\nIn the virtual classroom setup (and with many classes moving to the flipped classroom model), instructors shared the need to get insight into which students are following along and which ones are struggling, both in the classroom and outside of class.\n\nTo help instructors gain insight, we're adding new capabilities to our polls feature, as well as streamlining the creating, copying and editing of polls. We're also adding support to easily publish and close polls from our mobile apps. Students will be able to participate in real-time from their mobile apps as well. \n\nWe believe these enhancements to polls will allow instructors, who are otherwise unable to join several breakout rooms at once, better understand which students need help in the live classroom setting as well as outside of regular lectures.\n\nResponsive Interface, Localization & Accessibility\nWe\u2019re enhancing our user interface to better support the needs of our growing instructor- and student- base, in over 90 countries and 2,000 institutions. These enhancements are geared to support responsiveness (allowing users to easily access Piazza from devices with smaller screens), support Piazza in different languages, and increase accessibility by providing full site features for users who require additional assistance to access Piazza.\n\nWe are taking a thoughtful and measured approach to this redesign, understanding that many of you have come to rely on the easy-to-use and intuitive nature of Piazza's interface. Every decision in our redesign will be made to ensure we maintain the simplicity of our site, while also enabling us to serve a broader and more diverse community. As such, we anticipate that this redesign will take several months, and we appreciate your patience and guidance throughout this effort.\n\n\n* * *\n\nWe\u2019re grateful for the feedback that we received from so many of you on how to further improve our product. If you have input for our team as we design these or other features, please don\u2019t hesitate to drop us a note at  productfeedback@piazza.com. We truly appreciate hearing from you.\n\nPlease feel free to drop in (or have your colleagues drop in) for a live demo or office hour slot with our team at www.calendly.com/piazzasupport, or email us at team@piazza.com if we can help with setting up your class on Piazza.",

I thought this seemed way too simple and was wondering if there is something that I am missing.",

In this age of multimedia computers, audio and video entertainment systems, and digital communication systems, it is almost certain that you, the reader of this text, have formed some impression of the meaning of the terms <span class=\"ITS_blue\">signal</span> and <span class=\"ITS_blue\">system</span>, and you probably use the terms often in daily conversation.",

		"content" : "It is likely that your usage and understanding of the terms are correct within some rather broad definitions.  For example, you may think of a signal as &ldquo;something&rdquo; that carries information. Usually, that something is a pattern of variations of a physical quantity that can be manipulated, stored, or transmitted by physical processes. Examples include speech signals, audio signals, video or image signals, biomedical signals, radar signals, and seismic signals, to name just a few. An important point is that signals can take many equivalent forms or representations. For example, a speech signal is produced as an acoustic signal, but it can be converted to an electrical signal by a microphone, or a pattern of magnetization on a magnetic tape, or even a string of numbers as in digital audio recording.",

For example, we often use &ldquo;system&rdquo; to refer to a large organization that administers or implements some process, such as the &ldquo;Social Security system&rdquo; or the &ldquo;airline transportation system.&rdquo;  However, we will be interested in a much narrower definition that is very closely linked to signals. More specifically, a system, for our purposes, is something that can manipulate, change, record, or transmit signals. For example, an audio compact disk (CD) recording stores or represents a music signal as sequence of numbers. A CD player is a system for converting the numbers stored on the disk (i.e., the numerical representation of the signal) to an acoustic signal that we can hear.  In general, systems <span class=\"ITS_blue\">operate</span> on signals to produce new signals or new signal representations.",

However, for a variety of reasons that will become increasingly obvious as we progress through this text, it is often desirable to  obtain a discrete-time representation of a signal.  This can be done by <span class=\"ITS_blue\">sampling</span> a continuous-time signal at isolated, equally spaced points in time. The result is a sequence of numbers that can be represented as a function of an index variable that takes on only discrete values.  This can be represented mathematically as <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">s[n]=s(nT<sub>s</sub>)</span>, where <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">n</span> is an integer; i.e., <img class=\"ITS_TEX\" src=\"/cgi-bin/mimetex.exe?\\{\\dots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}\"/>, and <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">T<sub>s</sub></span> is the <span class=\"ITS_blue\">sampling period</span>.<sup><a href=\"#\" class=\"ITS_footnote\">[note]</a></sup>  This is, of course, exactly what we do when we plot values of a function on graph paper or on a computer screen.

This is a rather abstract definition, but it is useful as a starting point. To be more specific, we say that a one-dimensional continuous-time system takes an input signal <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">x(t)</span> and produces a corresponding output signal <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">y(t)</span>. This can be represented mathematically by <div class=\"ITS_EQUATION\"><img class=\"equation\" src=\"/cgi-bin/mimetex.exe?y(t)= \\mathcal{T}\\{x(t)\\}\"/></div> <div class=\"ITS_Image\"><center><img src=\"FILES/SP1Figures/Ch01/Fig01-04_squarer_system.png\" alt=\"FILES/SP1Figures/Ch01/Fig01-04_squarer_system.png\"></center><br><div class=\"ITS_Caption\">Output of a squarer system for the speech signal input of Fig. <a href=\"fig:intro-spchwave\" class=\"ITS_reference\">&raquo;</a>. The squarer system is defined by the equation <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">y(t) = [x(t)]<sup>2</sup></span></span></div></div> which means that the input signal (waveform, image, etc.) is operated on by the system (symbolized by the operator <img class=\"ITS_TEX\" src=\"/cgi-bin/mimetex.exe?\\mathcal{T}\\,\"/>) to produce the output <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">y(t)</span>. While this sounds very abstract at first, a simple example will show that this need not be mysterious.  Consider a system such that the output signal is the square of the input signal. The mathematical description of this system is simply <div class=\"ITS_EQUATION\">y(t) = [x(t)]<sup>2</sup></div> which says that at each time instant the value of the output is equal to the square of the input signal value at that same time. Such a index{Squarer system} system would logically be termed a &ldquo;squarer system.&rdquo; Figure <a href=\"fig:square-spchsys\" class=\"ITS_reference\">&raquo;</a> shows the output of the squarer for the input of Fig. <a href=\"fig:intro-spchwave\" class=\"ITS_reference\">&raquo;</a>.

This block diagram breaks the operation down into four subsystems.  The first operation is A-to-D (analog-to-digital)  conversion, which is a  physical approximation to the ideal C-to-D converter defined in <a href=\"eq:ctodeq\" class=\"ITS_reference\">&raquo;</a>. An A-to-D converter produces finite-precision numbers as samples of the input signal (quantized to a limited number of bits), while the ideal C-to-D converter produces samples with infinite precision.  For the high-accuracy A-to-D converters used in precision audio systems, the difference between an A-to-D converter and our idealized C-to-D converter is slight, but the distinction is very important.

This is a complex process, but for our purposes it is sufficient to simply show it as a single operation.

Most of the time we do not need to think about how such systems work, but this example illustrates the value of thinking about a complex system in a hierarchical form.  In this way, we can first understand the individual parts, then the relationship among the parts, and finally the whole system. By looking at the CD audio system in this manner, we see that a very important issue is the conversion from continuous-time to discrete-time and back to continuous-time, and we see that it is possible to consider these operations separately from the other parts of the system. The effect of connecting the parts is then relatively easy to understand. Details of some parts can be left to experts in other fields who, for example,  can develop more detailed breakdowns of the optical disk subsystems.",

In Chapter <a href=\"chapter:two-sinusoids\" class=\"ITS_reference\">&raquo;</a>, we will start at a basic mathematical level and show how the well-known sine and cosine functions from trigonometry play a fundamental role in signal and system theory. Next, we will show how complex numbers can simplify the algebra of trigonometric functions. Subsequent chapters will introduce the concept of the frequency spectrum of a signal and the concept of filtering with a linear time-invariant system.  By the end of the book, the diligent reader who has worked the problems, experienced the demonstrations, and done the laboratory exercises will be rewarded with a solid understanding of many of the key concepts underlying the digital multimedia information  systems that are rapidly becoming commonplace.",

Although it is an oversimplification to equate notes to sinusoids and pitch to frequency, the mathematics of sinusoids is an essential first step to understanding complicated sound signals.",

Linear interpolation certainly cannot achieve this result, but, in Chapter <a href=\"chapter:four-sampling\" class=\"ITS_reference\">&raquo;</a>, where we examine the sampling process in more detail, we will illustrate how this remarkable result can be achieved.

Although the introduction of the unfamiliar and seemingly artificial concept of complex  exponential signals may at first seem to be making the problem more difficult, we will soon see the value in this new representation. Before introducing the complex exponential signal, we will first review some basic concepts concerning complex numbers.

Thus it is useful to develop a mechanism for adding several sinusoids having the same frequency, <i>but with different amplitudes and phases.</i>  Our goal is to prove that the following statement is true: <div class=\"ITS_EQUATION\"><img class=\"equation\" src=\"/cgi-bin/mimetex.exe?\\sum_{k=1}^N A_k \\cos(\\omega_0 t +\\phi_k) = A \\cos(\\omega_0 t +\\phi)\"/></div> Equation <a href=\"eq:sum-cosines\" class=\"ITS_reference\">&raquo;</a> states that a sum of <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">N</span> cosine signals of differing amplitudes and phase shifts, but with the same frequency, can always be reduced to a single cosine signal of the same frequency. A proof of  <a href=\"eq:sum-cosines\" class=\"ITS_reference\">&raquo;</a> can be accomplished by using trigonometric identities such as <div class=\"ITS_EQUATION\"><img class=\"equation\" src=\"/cgi-bin/mimetex.exe?\\begin{align} A_k\\cos(\\omega_0 t + \\phi_k) = A_k &\\cos\\phi_k \\cos(\\omega_0 t)\\\\ &- A_k \\sin\\phi_k \\sin(\\omega_0 t)\\\\ \\end{align}\"/></div> We can expand the sum <a href=\"eq:sum-cosines\" class=\"ITS_reference\">&raquo;</a> into sines and cosines, collect terms involving <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">cos(&omega;<sub>0</sub> t)</span> and those involving <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">sin(&omega;<sub>0</sub> t)</span>, and then finally use the same identity <a href=\"eq:trigident\" class=\"ITS_reference\">&raquo;</a> in the reverse direction. However, this is exceedingly tedious to do as a numerical computation (see Exercise <a href=\"exer:sum-sinusoids\" class=\"ITS_reference\">&raquo;</a>), and it leads to some very messy expressions if we wish to obtain a general formula. As we will see, a much simpler approach can be based on the complex exponential representation of the cosine signals.",

Now that we know a lot more about sinusoidal signals, it is worthwhile to take up this issue again. Is it a coincidence that the tuning-fork signal looks like a sinusoid, or is there a deeper connection between vibrations and sinusoids?  In this section, we present a simple analysis of the tuning-fork system that shows that the tuning fork does indeed vibrate sinusoidally when given a displacement from its equilibrium position. The sinusoidal motion of the tuning-fork tines is transferred to the surrounding air particles, thereby producing the acoustic signal that we hear. This simple example illustrates how mathematical models of physical systems that are derived from fundamental physical principles can lead to concise mathematical descriptions of physical phenomena and of signals that result.",

This is particularly true when the experiment involves listening to the sound produced. In the tuning-fork experiment, we perceive a tone with a certain pitch (related to the frequency) and loudness (related to the amplitude). The human ear and neural processing system  respond to the frequency and amplitude  of a sustained sound like that produced by the tuning fork, but the phase is not perceptible. This is because phase is really due to an arbitrary definition of the starting time of the sinusoid; i.e., a sustained tone sounds the same now as it did 5 minutes ago. On the other hand, we could pick up the sound with a microphone and sample  or display the signal on an oscilloscope. In this case, it would be possible to make precise measurements of frequency and amplitude, but phase would be measured accurately only with respect to the time base of the sampler or the oscilloscope.",

Signals, as we have defined them, are varying patterns that convey or represent information, usually about the state or behavior of a physical system. We have seen by both theory and observation that a tuning fork generates a signal that can be represented mathematically as a sinusoidal signal.  In the context of the tuning fork, the cosine wave conveys and represents information about the state of the tuning fork. Encoded in the sinusoidal waveform is information such as whether the tuning fork is vibrating or at rest, and, if it is vibrating,  its frequency and the amplitude of its vibrations. This information can be extracted from the signal by human listeners, or it can be recorded for later processing by either humans or computers.",

Figure <a href=\"fig:orch-music\" class=\"ITS_reference\">&raquo;</a> shows a short segment of a recording of orchestra music.  Just the appearance of the waveform suggests a much more complex situation. Although it oscillates like the cosine wave, it clearly is not periodic (at least, as far as we can see from the given segment). Orchestra music consists of many instruments sounding different notes together.  If each instrument produced a pure sinusoidal tone at the frequency of the note that is assigned to it, then  the composite orchestra signal would be simply a sum of sinusoids with different frequencies, amplitudes, and phase shifts.  While this is far from being a correct model for most instruments, it is actually a highly appropriate way to think about the orchestra signal. In fact, we will see very soon that sums of sinusoids of different frequencies, amplitudes, and phase shifts can result in an infinite variety of waveforms. Indeed, it is true that almost any signal can be represented as a sum of sinusoidal signals. When this concept was first introduced by Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier in 1807, it was received with great skepticism by the famous mathematicians of the world. Nowadays, this notion is commonplace (although no less remarkable). The mathematical and computational techniques of Fourier analysis  underlie the frequency-domain analysis tools used extensively in electrical engineering and other areas of science and engineering.",

We have attempted to show that they arise naturally as a result of simple physical processes and that they can be represented by familiar mathematical functions, and also by complex exponentials. The value of the mathematical representation of a signal is twofold. First, the mathematical representation provides a convenient formula to consistently describe the signal. For example, the cosine signal is completely described in terms of just three parameters.  Second, by representing both signals and systems through mathematical expressions, we can make precise statements about the interaction between signals and systems.",

Later in this chapter, we will show some extraordinarily complicated waveforms that can be constructed from rather simple combinations of  basic cosine waves. The most general and powerful method for producing new signals from sinusoids is the <i> additive linear combination</i>, where a signal is created by adding together a constant and <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">N</span> sinusoids, each with a different frequency, amplitude, and phase.

For very short time intervals, the music may have a &ldquo;constant&rdquo; spectrum, but over the long term, the frequency content of the music changes mbox{dramatically.} Indeed, the changing frequency spectrum is the very essence of music. Human speech is another good example. Vowel sounds, if held for a long time,  exhibit a &ldquo;constant&rdquo; nature because the vocal tract resonates with its characteristic frequency components. However, as we speak different words, the frequency content is continually changing. In any event, most interesting signals can be modelled as a sum of sinusoids if we let the frequencies, amplitudes, and phases vary with time. Therefore, we need a way to describe such time&mdash;frequency variations. This leads  us to the concept of a time&mdash;frequency spectrum or <span class=\"ITS_blue\">spectrogram</span>.",

For example, in the audible region, we might begin at 220 Hz and go up to 2320 Hz. One method for producing  such a signal would be to concatenate a large number of short constant-frequency sinusoids, whose frequencies step from low to high. This approach has one notable disadvantage:  The boundary between the short sinusoids will be discontinuous unless we are careful to adjust the initial phase of each small sinusoid.

It is also common to refer to such signals as <span class=\"ITS_blue\">analog</span>  signals because both the signal amplitude and the time variable are assumed to be real (not discrete) numbers. Continuous-time signals are represented mathematically by functions of time, <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">x(t)</span>, where <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">t</span> is a continuous variable. In earlier chapters, we have &ldquo;plotted&rdquo; analog waveforms using MATLAB, but actually we did not plot the continuous-time waveform. Instead, we really plotted the waveform only at isolated (discrete) points in time and then connected those points with straight lines. Indeed, digital computers cannot deal  with continuous-time signals directly; instead, they must represent and manipulate them numerically  (as with MATLAB), or sometimes symbolically (as with <i> Mathematica</i> or <i> Maple</i>). The key point is that any computer representation is <i> discrete</i>.

How would we plot the spectrum of a discrete-time signal?  Aliasing makes this problematic because a given discrete-time sinusoidal sequence could correspond to an infinite number of different frequencies <img class=\"ITS_TEX\" src=\"/cgi-bin/mimetex.exe?\\hat\\omega\"/>.  Our approach will be to take this into account by making a plot that explicitly shows that there are many different sinusoids that have the same samples.  Figure <a href=\"fig:DTspectrum\" class=\"ITS_reference\">&raquo;</a> shows that we do this by drawing the spectrum representation of the principal alias along with several more of the other aliases. footnote{We should draw an infinite number of aliases, but we  cannot show them all.} <div class=\"ITS_Image\"><center><img src=\"FILES/SP1Figures/Ch04/Fig04-05_DTspectrum120.png\" alt=\"FILES/SP1Figures/Ch04/Fig04-05_DTspectrum120.png\"></center><br><div class=\"ITS_Caption\">Spectrum of a discrete-time sinusoid.

The two frequency components between <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">&plusmn; &pi;</span> are <img class=\"ITS_TEX\" src=\"/cgi-bin/mimetex.exe?\\hat\\omega = \\pm 0.4\\pi\"/>, but the one at <img class=\"ITS_TEX\" src=\"/cgi-bin/mimetex.exe?\\hat\\omega = +0.4\\pi\"/> is an alias of <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">-1.6&pi;</span>.

An additional fact about folding is that the sign of the phase of the signal will be changed. If the original 100-Hz sinusoid had a phase of <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">&phi; = +&pi;/3</span>, then the phase of the component at <img class=\"ITS_TEX\" src=\"/cgi-bin/mimetex.exe?\\hat\\omega = -1.6\\pi\"/> would be <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">-&pi;/3</span>, and it follows that the phase of the aliased component at <img class=\"ITS_TEX\" src=\"/cgi-bin/mimetex.exe?\\hat\\omega = +0.4\\pi\"/> would also be <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">-&pi;/3</span>. After reconstruction, the phase of <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">y(t)</span> would be <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">-&pi;/3</span>. It is possible to observe this &ldquo;phase-reversal&rdquo; in the middle panel of Fig. <a href=\"fig:samp4\" class=\"ITS_reference\">&raquo;</a>. The input signal (solid orange line) is going down at <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">t=0</span>, while the reconstructed output (black dashed line) is going up. What this means is that when we sample a 100 Hz sinusoid at a sampling rate of 125 samples/sec, we get the same samples that we would have gotten by sampling a 25 Hz sinusoid.",

This pulse consists of four cubic spline (third-order polynomial) segments. Note that it has a duration that is twice that of the triangular pulse and four times that of the square pulse.

The top panel of Fig. <a href=\"fig:cubic-spline1\" class=\"ITS_reference\">&raquo;</a> shows the original  83-Hz waveform (solid gray), its samples (<span class=\"ITS_HTML\">&fnof;<sub>s</sub>=200</span> samples/sec), and the shifted and scaled pulses <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">y[n]p(t-n T<sub>s</sub>)</span> (dashed orange).

Then the interpolation formula will involve several neighboring samples in the computation of each output value  <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">y(t)</span>. However, the sampling rate is another important factor. If the original waveform does not vary much over the duration of <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">p(t)</span>, then we will also obtain a good reconstruction. One way to ensure this is by over-sampling, i.e., using a sampling rate that is much greater than the frequency of the cosine wave. This is illustrated in Figs. <a href=\"fig:square2\" class=\"ITS_reference\">&raquo;</a>, <a href=\"fig:triangle2\" class=\"ITS_reference\">&raquo;</a>, and <a href=\"fig:cubic-spline2\" class=\"ITS_reference\">&raquo;</a>, where the frequency of the cosine wave is still <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">&fnof;<sub>0</sub>=83</span> Hz, but the sampling frequency has been raised to <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">&fnof;<sub>s</sub>=500</span> samples/sec. Now the reconstruction pulses are the same shape as in Fig. <a href=\"fig:pulses\" class=\"ITS_reference\">&raquo;</a>, but they are much shorter, since <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">T<sub>s</sub> = 2</span> msec instead of 5 msec. The signal changes much less over the duration of a single pulse, so the waveform appears &ldquo;smoother&rdquo; and is much easier to reconstruct accurately using only a few samples. Note that even for the case of the square pulse (Fig. <a href=\"fig:square2\" class=\"ITS_reference\">&raquo;</a>) the reconstruction is better, but still discontinuous; the triangular pulse (Fig. <a href=\"fig:triangle2\" class=\"ITS_reference\">&raquo;</a>) gives an excellent approximation; and the cubic-spline pulse gives a reconstruction that is indistinguishable from the original signal on the plotting scale of Fig. <a href=\"fig:cubic-spline2\" class=\"ITS_reference\">&raquo;</a>.",

We have shown that this process can be approximated very well by a sum of pulses <a href=\"eq:dtoc\" class=\"ITS_reference\">&raquo;</a>. One question remains: What is the pulse shape that gives &ldquo;ideal D-to-C conversion&rdquo;?  In Ch. <a href=\"chap:FourierTransformApplications\" class=\"ITS_reference\">&raquo;</a>, we&lsquo;ll show that it is given by the following equation: <div class=\"ITS_EQUATION\"><img class=\"equation\" src=\"/cgi-bin/mimetex.exe?p(t) = \\frac{{ \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{T_s} t}}{ {\\frac{\\pi}{T_s} t}} \\qquad \\mbox{for $-\\infty < t < \\infty$\"/></div> This is a very long pulse, and its infinite length implies that to reconstruct a signal at time <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">t</span> exactly from its samples requires <i> all</i> the samples, not just those around that time. The lower right part of Fig. <a href=\"fig:pulses\" class=\"ITS_reference\">&raquo;</a> shows this pulse over the interval <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">-2.6 T<sub>s</sub> < t < 2.6 T<sub>s</sub> </span>. It decays outside this interval, but never does reach and stay at zero. Since the pulse has zeros at multiples of <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">T<sub>s</sub></span>, this type of reconstruction is still an interpolation process, called <i> bandlimited interpolation.</i> Using this pulse to reconstruct from samples of a cosine wave will always produce a cosine wave exactly. If the sampling rate satisfies the conditions of the sampling theorem, the reconstructed cosine wave will be identical to the original signal that was sampled. If aliasing occurred in sampling, the ideal D-to-C converter reconstructs a cosine wave with the alias frequency that is less than <span class=\"ITS_HTML\">f<sub>s</sub>/2</span>.",
